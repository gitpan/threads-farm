=head1 CAVEATS

Passing unshared values between threads is accomplished by serializing the
specified values using C<Storable>.  This allows for great flexibility at
the expense of more CPU usage.  It also limits what can be passed, as e.g.
code references can B<not> be serialized and therefor not be passed.

=head1 SEE ALSO
